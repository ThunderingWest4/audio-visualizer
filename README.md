music audio visualizer. bouncey bars go bounce

at the moment, all it really does is make bouncey bars with song title/author and you have to manually select each song (no queues)

how to use - use the "choose file" to choose an audio file with the name formatted as <SongTitle\>-<SongAuthor\>.<fileExtension\>. for example, for the song Stressed Out in an mp3 format, the song would have to be saved as "Stressed Out-Twenty One Pilots.mp3"

Todo: 
- add queues
- switch between dark and light background
- make the control thing actually work and not bad
- bouncey bars in a circle shape
- song loop?
- play from youtube/spotify

idk how much i'll actually end up adding but those are my goals
